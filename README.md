`taffy` is a flexible, high-performance, cross-platform UI layout library written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).

Currently, we only support a [flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) layout algorithm, but support for other paradigms [is planned](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/taffy/issues/28).

This crate is a collaborative, cross-team project, and is designed to be used as a dependency for other UI and GUI libraries.
Right now, it powers:

- [Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/): a React-like library for building fast, portable, and beautiful user interfaces with Rust
- [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/): an ergonomic, ECS-first Rust game engine
