Stretch2 is an implementation of Flexbox written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).
The goal of stretch2 is to provide a solid foundation for layout across all platforms with a specific focus on mobile.
Long term we want stretch2 to not only support flexbox but also many other layout algorithms such as grid layout.
Stretch was made for and powers <https://visly.app>.
