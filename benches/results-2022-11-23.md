# Benchmarks (Taffy 0.2 vs Taffy 0.1 and Yoga)

- Using [this branch](https://github.com/nicoburns/taffy/tree/0.1-benchmarks) that backports the new benchmarks to the `0.1` tag.
- Run on a 2021 MacBook Pro with M1 Pro processor.
- Taffy benchmarks are using criterion (10 iterations).
- Yoga benchmarks run via the `yoga-layout-prebuilt` npm package, they were run a few times manually and it was verified that variance in the numbers of each run was minimal. It should be noted that this is using an old version of Yoga.
