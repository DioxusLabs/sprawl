# Contributing

This is a cross-team project, aiming to build solid foundations for Rust UI libraries of all sorts.
New contributions are extremely welcome!

The basic process is simple:

1. Pick an issue, or file a new one.
2. Comment in the issue that you plan to tackle it, and the team will assign the task to you.
3. Submit a PR.
4. Respond to feedback from reviewers and make sure CI passes.

PR review is completely open: if you'd like to help us comment on, test and approve PRs.

Questions of "how do I use this library" belong in GitHub Discussions, although those should typically spawn new issues to improve our docs and examples.

If you'd like to help on a consistent basis or are interested in project management, create a Discussions post, and we'll be happy to hand out triage rights.
